# python-challenge

I had worked on this assignment a few weeks back.  Reviewed in office hours few times and covered the issue I was having with looping in tutor session at that time.
Stopped working on this one and moved ahead to complete next module challenge. 
Today finished with PyBank and reviewed three outstanding items with tutor today that I was not finding correct solutions in research.
